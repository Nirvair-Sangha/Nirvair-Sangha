### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Junior at the University of Texas at Dallas, majoring in Computer Science. I have had work experience as a Software Developer Intern working on both the frontend and backend utilizing various frameworks within JavaScript like Node.js, React, and Express. I tend to work on personal projects in both Java and Python with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. I love working on unique ideas with extensive applications to real world situations as well as doing research on these topics. In my free time I enjoy weightlifting, basketball, and building computers. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on side projects that apply neural networks to real life scenarios and different ways to apply data structures and algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Machine Learning and Deep Learning using SciKit-Learn, Keras, and PyTorch.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source projects that allow me to improve as a programmer in Java, Python, and JavaScript.
